# Day 1 Exercise 2, Debugging:

""" Look at the code, there are some errors in all the lines of code. Fix the
    code below, so that it runs without errors:
        print(Day 1 - String Manipulation")
        print("String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.")
            print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
        print(("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")"""

# Error 1: Missing the double quotes before the word Day
print("\nDay 1 - String Manipulation")

# Error 2: Outer double quotes changed to a single quotes
print('String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.')

# Error 3: Extra indentation was removed
print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')

# Error 4: Extra "(" in print function was removed
print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")
